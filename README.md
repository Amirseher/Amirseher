What can I say, I skipped all this "programming" time from assembler. 
My last project was Borland Turbo Pascal / Assembler and projects on 6502/ 68000 / 8086 ... Pentium. 
In the meantime, I was a user of ready-made programs and implemented them in industry and entertainment. 
And now I need something for pensions, so I started in this environment because I think I can still find some traces of programming from my time, so it will be easy for me to move on.
